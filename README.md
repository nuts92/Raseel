# Raseel App

This is the repository for the Single Screen App Project required by Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program. 

### App Description
Raseel app is a Simple Android App which acts more like a landing page for a Same Day Delivery Courier called Raseel. Usually the main purpose of a landing page is to introduce main information about the company and what differentiates it from other competitors in order to generate leads and conversions like having clients contact the business, claim an offer or sign up.
The App displays basic information about the business including the services offered by the company for businesses and how the customers can contact them if they're interested in knowing how Raseel as a courier can help them to achieve their business goals.

Since this project is about building a Single Screen App and taking into consideration that the information I wanted to include requires more than a single page or screen space. I've designed this app in a way that takes adavntage of the available space in the best way, while at the same time displays all the essential information that must be presented in order to intrigue the client to contact the business and hopefully will become a future lead. 

### App Features
The App displays the business logo, an Introductory slogan, and also displays the courier's six services in the form of scrollable cards using a ViewPager. The contact information are displayed in the form of four buttons, when the user clicks on 
any of them, a pop up card/dialog shows up displaying the information and also a "Call To Action" button along with it. The App also takes into consideration configuration changes like a switch between the portait and the landscape mode.
